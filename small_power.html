    <h1>Summertime Power in a Small (3000 sqft) Shop or Resturant</h1>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="cell">
            The smallest electrical system in Lawrence's downtown is the electrical system in one small shop or resturant, which typically occupies one lot and it two stories tall.
        </div>
        <div class="cell">
            One lot is 25 feet wide and 120 feet deep. Most of the downtown properties are this size. However, some are taller and/or occupy two or more lots. For one of these larger properties, scale up the values of the table below.

    <h2>Typical System Description</h2>
    <p>
    To avoid rooftop HVAC clutter, maximise efficency, and facilitate storage, a ground-source heat pump heats and cools water for HVAC amd provides free heat for domestic hot water during the cooling season. Peek electrical consumption (at 4:00 PM) is about 7.5kW. At peak cooling load, the HVAC equipment consumes 4 kW. At noon, the HVAC cooling equipment uses 2 kW to cool spaces and 2 kW to chill water for storage and use at a later time.
